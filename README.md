# Databases Project

## Description

Implemented a gelato ice cream shop web app using databases for login page, feedback forms and quizzes for my databases project at university.

## Structure

### Main page

When you enter the site, you can see a login form that will redirect you either on the user or admin pages, depending on your input.

### User page

I included a page for the user. 
On top of it you can see a menu with the following pages: About us, Contact and Menu.
The purpose of it is so that the user can see the Menu online and then visit the physical shop.

### Admin page

I included a page for the admin.
The admin has a totally different page, where he can manage the informations of his business, such as the employees or the current menu.

It has a few CRUD operations that can be done on both of the tables (the employee and the menu tables): create, update (price/salary/etc) and delete.

## Visuals

The visuals of the project will soon be added.

## Technologies used

The technologies used in this project are PHP for the backend of the site and also HTML and CSS for styling.
I used XAMPP for the database part of the project.

## Project Status

This was a project for the Databases laboratory at my university. Its status is currently closed and finished (on deadline) :)
